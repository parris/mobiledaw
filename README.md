What is this?
----

Mobile -> DAW is a project started at music hack day 2013. It allows you to take tap events from multiple mobile devices and convert them to midi notes. You can then take these MIDI notes send them into a DAW like Ableton, Protools, Fruity Loops, Cubase, etc and do anything you want to the signal.

Why
----

For a long time people have wanted to jam online with other people. While this isn't neccesarily possible with our current infrastructure or typical internet latency this project shows the potential for jamming online with virtual instruments or anything that sends midi signals.

For our music hack day project we demo'd this on a private network in 1 single room and it worked great!

Now all we need is 20 trillion dollars to make this work every where (jk... sorta).
